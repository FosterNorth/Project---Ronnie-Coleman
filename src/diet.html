      Ronnie Colemanâ€™s diet was a very key part of his bodybuilding career. He would prepare his meals for work, and even stop by the house for more while on the clock. His diet mainly consisted of carbs and protein with carbs being higher. The reason behind this is because he already was consuming between 5000-6000 calories a day and if that was more protein than carbs he would have way too much protein per pound of muscle and it would be overkill. So the carbs being cheaper and a good source for adding weight was perfect for him. The actual foods he ate were usually chicken, beef, rice, potatoes, and protein powder. With lots of water to stay hydrated throughout the day.
