      Ronnie Coleman's Attitude has changed the fitness industry drastically. Almost every single competitor is so focused on winning and mad at something in their life, but Ronnie Coleman has always had a good spirit with a smile on his face. This might contribute to his success because he was always yelling positive statements while lifting, even when he was in a lot of pain. It has definitely caused other people to follow in his footsteps, trying to be as happy as they can be for anyone to have a chat. He even coined the phrase “Yeah buddy” and “it's lightweight”. A lot of people yell this terms as a way to push on his legacy.
