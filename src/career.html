        Before Ronnie Coleman was a professional bodybuilder he was actually a police officer. He served from 1989-200 as a regular police officer, and then 3 more years as a reserve officer. He actually won the mr olympia from 1998-2005 which means his careers overlapped for a majority of his bodybuilding. While doing police reports he would eat his home cooked meals. He also made sure to have his police work close to home so he can stop by his house whenever he needs more fuel while still on the clock for work.
