      Ronnie Coleman had a unique workout routine compared to other Mr. Olympia contenders. As said previously he would lift heavy weight. He would max out constantly which led to a lot of his injuries, but it also led to him becoming as big as he was. His highest leg press was 2300 pounds, and his highest squat was 823 for 2 reps, which he claims he could have gone even more. The workout routine he followed the longest was Monday: Chest and Triceps, Tuesday: Back and Biceps, Wednesday: Rest Day, Thursday: Shoulders, Friday: Legs, Saturday: Arms, Sunday: Rest Day. He had around 5-6 different exercises each day with 5 sets, 12 reps.
