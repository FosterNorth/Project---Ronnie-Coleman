      Ronnie has had a total of 13 surgeries done on his body throughout his life. Most of them were done after his bodybuilding career ended. The main injury he has is his spine. He broke every single disc in his back and continued to lift heavy through each one. He also severely injured his back, shoulder, hips, and neck due to heavy weightlifting. He can no longer walk from all the heavy lifting, but the surgeries were really the things that disabled him. They put giant metal rods in his back that make it so he canâ€™t move his upper body much at all. Most of his injuries could have been prevented if he got help years prior.
