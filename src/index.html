      Ronnie Coleman is an 8x Mr. Olympia winner. He started competing in contests so that he could get a free gym membership. He never pictured winning but his combination of genetics and attitude in the gym had him win the most amount of mr. olympia’s in all of history. He also was a powerlifter which is unique because most competitors in the olympia didn’t try to max out, and went for more of a high rep low weight method of training.
